Gandalf the Grey, later known as Gandalf the White, and originally named Ol?in, was an Istar (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin II Oakenshield and his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One Ring, and led the Free Peoples in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.

## History

### Years of the Lamps

Originally called Ol?in, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Il?vatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into E?.[2] In his "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served Manw?, Varda, Irmo and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda.[3] Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows of the Children of Il?vatar and drove those who listened to him out of despair.[3]

When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manw? and Varda decided to include Ol?in among the five who were sent. At first, Ol?in was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid of Sauron. Manw? understood, and told him that was one main reason why he should go - to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One Ring, which held much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, Manw? insisted that Ol?in should go as the third, but Varda convinced him to have Ol?in go as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same time the Necromancer appeared in Mirkwood.

### The Third Age

###### Arrival in Middle-earth

Ol?in, like the other Wizards, took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey and went about as a wanderer and counsellor. At Mithlond he was welcomed by Glorfindel, his friend from Valinor (who had been sent earlier on a similar mission), and C?dan the shipwright, who possessed Narya, one of the Three Elven Rings of Power. C?dan divined in Ol?in a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged old man. C?dan gave Narya to Ol?in with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours.[5]

He then began his sojourn in Middle-earth and during many years, he walked among the elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. Unlike Saruman, Ol?in did not take up a single permanent residence and never went to the east[6], apparently restricting his activities to the Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the D?nedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he wandered: Elves named him Mithrandir, the "Grey Pilgrim", while the men of Arnor named him Gandalf, which became his most common name. He was also known as Inc?us (in the south), and Thark?n to the Dwarves.[4] He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as not only the wisest but also the most powerful individual in that order.

A legend says that Gandalf was given by Yavanna the Elfstone of E?endil, to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth as a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to Galadriel, bearer of one of the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it to an individual who would also be called Elessar.[7]
